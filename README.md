### Object in javascript

Hi, today we're going to study some things about objects in JavaScript.

What is an Object? Object is a data type made with keys and values. For example:

```javascript
var myFirstObject = {
    name: 'Jhon',
    age: 23
}
```

So 'name' and 'age' are the keys and 'Jhon' and 23 are the values. It is very important and easy to use for example to use it you just put:

```javascript
console.log(myFisrtObject.name);
console.log(myFirstObject.age);
```

You will see respectively 'Jhon' and 23. Thanks to read it. See you in the next article.
